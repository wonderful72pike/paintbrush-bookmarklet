# Paintbrush Bookmarklet #
A JavaScript bookmarklet that lets you draw on any webpage in any color you want.

# Installation #
Select all of the code in Paintbrush.js (CTRL+A the Raw page) and drag it to your Bookmarks bar, then name it Paintbrush or whatever you want. Alternatively, you can just copy the code and paste it as the URL of a bookmark you make yourself, which might be a bit easier or something.

# Controls/Instructions #
- To toggle the brush, press D.
- To toggle the eraser, press E.
- To set the brush's color, press C and enter a valid CSS color (name, hex, RGB(A), etc.)

# Known Issues #
- It will not turn off if you type into an input box. It could get really annoying.
- My lack of knowledge on how to format README files.
- Any issues someone tells me about.
